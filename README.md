## Background
Recently bought a MINI Countryman F60 LCI registered end 2020. There is a big software update in Mar 2021 for that model, so most of the LCI models are getting the new software, early built ones missed out. Trying to retrofit that and also wants to retrofit Driving Assistant (pedestrian recognition and traffic sign info)

## What is needed
- Need a Windows 10 laptop (this was done by upgrading an old macbookpro)
- Need ISTA+ for programming (don't know how to use e-sys to program), this will take about 380G of disk spaces, so definitely go for 1T SSD drives
- Need e-sys for VO and FDL coding
- Need FSC codes
- Need a Ethernet to OBD2 cable
